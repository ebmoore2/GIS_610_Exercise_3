# GIS_610_Exercise_3

This is a collection of python files answering questions 5-10.
I attempted Extra Credit questions 12-13.
Each .py is for one question at a time.
This contains a word document answering question 1-4 & 11.


# ********Extra Credit Notes********
For questions 12 & 13, I attemped them, but had trouble making the selection stick when exporting.

Q12, I caused it to create an empty csv file with just the field headers.
*********************when including the "where" as in where_clause, the csv is just EMPTY**************************
................without "where" it just exports the entire csv without selecting out "Home/Res" and "BURGLARY FORCE"............

Q13, it successfully imports the shapefiles, but in the next steps it creates a new feature class that is supposed to be "Maricopa_County" but turns out to be all US counties. "Maricopa_Tracts" turns out to be all AZ census tracts, a copy of original "Tracts" layer.

Again, I can't get the SQL to "stick". **Need help/advice on how to write SQL into Python.** Everything else is good.
