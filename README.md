# GIS_610_Exercise_3

This is a collection of python files answering questions 5-10.
I attempted Extra Credit questions 12-13.
Each .py is for one question at a time.
This contains a word document answering question 1-4 & 11.

For questions 12 & 13, I attemped them, but had trouble making the selection stick when exporting.
For Q12, I caused it to create an empty csv file with just the field headers.
For Q13, it successfully imports the shapefiles, but in the next steps it creates a new feature class that is suppossed to be "Maricopa_County" but turns out to be all US counties. "Maricopa_Tracts" but turns out to be all AZ census tracts.
